This repo is a compilation of tutorials and examples using [`PyScript`](https://pyscript.github.io/docs/2024.1.1/) which embeds python into HTML.

I created this repo for project research on Python Web Apps.

## Prerequisites for using PyScript:

- Install JS Backend Framework: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Install the Node Package Manager: [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- Install a Python Environment: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Optional but highly recommended:
- Install the Node Version Manager: [NVM](https://tecadmin.net/how-to-install-nvm-on-ubuntu-20-04/)
    - This allows multiple versions of NPM to be installed as parallel installations.

- Install a Python Environment Management system like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html).
    - This allows multiple versions of Python to be installed as parallel environments.

- Add the `mamba` package dependency solver, which is much faster than the pre-existing `conda` package dependency solver: `conda install mamba`
    - Refer to the docs for [`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
    
- Another alternative is the `Miniforge3` aka [`MambaForge`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases) which "holds the minimal installers for Conda and Mamba specific to conda-forge, with the following features pre-configured:
    - Packages in the base environment are obtained from the conda-forge channel.
    - The conda-forge channel is set as the default (and only) channel."
        - [source](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)
